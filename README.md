# Event Guest List Manager

Event Guest List Manager is a JavaScript application for managing event attendees. It uses JavaScript to manipulate DOM.

## Project Overview

This application demonstrates fundamental web development concepts using vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation without relying on frameworks. It allows event organizers to:
1. Track guests (maximum limit is 10)
2. Categorize the guests whether they are family, friends or colleagues
3. Monitor RSVP status (attending or not) and edit guest information as needed

The project showcases dynamic content creation, event handling, and responsive design principles.
